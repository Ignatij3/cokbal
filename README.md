Program counts amount of entries of element of continued fractions.

Folder "bin" contains executable file.
Folder "docs" contains documentation.
Folder "src" contains source code of the program.

Executable file should be launched through command-line with following flags:
   -r       - radius of the quarter
   -workers - amount of concurrent workers
   -timeout - time in minutes, after which program stops calculations prematurely

File with results will be saved after program exits. Results may not be final.
To get final results, you should wait until program finished running without timeout.
